# Button Component

To add buttons, use the following code.

```
<button type="button" class="button">Default</button>
```

There are a few main types of buttons:
- ```info``` / Gives the button a blue color
- ```success``` / Gives the button a green color
- ```warning``` / Gives the button a yellow color
- ```danger``` / Gives the button a red color

There are also 4 sizes: ```mini```, ```small```, ````medium````, and ```large```. Lastly, there are filled buttons, which fill the button with its class color.

```html
<button type="button" class="button filled">Default filled</button>
```

And there are shadow buttons, that provide a shadow for decoration purposes.

```html
<button type="button" name="button shadow">Default Shadow</button>
```
You can also disable a button using the ```disabled``` class.
